Product name: HTML Translator
Product description: HTML Translator utility has been developed for bulk conversion of English HTML pages to Hindi. The folder is scanned for all existing Web pages to which the processing logic based on rules of domain specific terms and terminologies, followed by transliteration is applied. Acronyms are also handled by this utility. The font sizes for applications created for Hindi often needs to be modified in a ratio / factor for better clarity of the ascenders, descenders, diacritic marks, etc. This also caters to the CSS (cascading style sheets) for applying format information uniformly to the webpage. This utility not only converts the data but also adjusts the fonts according to the ratio set.The problems related to font size variations have been tackled with the introduction of specially designed UI Screen Fonts for bilingual User Interface. It renders Indian language text with more clarity on the web. If any English text is to be kept along side (eg: English numbers or acronyms) the data appears uniform. The CSS or height of font matches for keeping better sync with the User Interface of the corresponding English application. The font is used as a dynamic font (Embedded Open Type: EOT) so the user does not need to physically download the font for rendering the data.

Product name: ENOVISION
Product description: The ENOVISION system works on a sensor fusion technology where an array of non-specific Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) Sensors captures the volatile compounds emanated by Black Tea samples and a digital camera captures the image of the sample under a uniform illumination condition. The multi-dimensional MOS sensor outputs along with the captured image by the digital camera are stored in the PC through PC-based Data Acquisition Systems. These stored image and aroma signatures of the Black Tea sample are analyzed through intelligent pattern recognition algorithm for clustering, classification and measurement of Black tea quality in terms of aroma and appearance.
The hardware part of the system consists of a) odour handling and delivery system, b) sensor array PCB, c) data acquisition PCB with capability of analog and digital I/O and USB interface, d) valve control PCB, e) solenoid valves for headspace control and f) enclosure cabinet of the system g) digital camera h) Uniform LED based illumination i) Sample holding tray with different types of sample holding attachments.
The software is based on WindowsÂ® platform. The E-Nose software is developed with National Instrument LabVIEWÂ® and the E-Vision software is developed using Visual C++. Microsoft Access forms the backend database for the software.
"
"Electronic Nose:
Electronic Nose is a smart instrument that is designed to detect and discriminate amongst complex odours using an array of sensors. The array of sensors is made up of a number of broadly tuned and non-specific sensors.
An odour stimulus generates a characteristic fingerprint from this array of sensors. Patterns or fingerprints from known odours are used to construct a database and train a pattern recognition algorithm so that unknown odours can subsequently be classified and/or identified.
Such an Electronic Nose system consists of four functional blocks, namely: (a) Odour Handling and Delivery System, (b) Sensors and Interface Electronics, (c) Signal Processing and (d) Intelligent Pattern Analysis and Recognition. The array of sensors is exposed to volatile odour vapour through suitable odour handling and delivery system that ensures constant exposure rate to each of the sensors. The response signals of sensor array are conditioned and processed through suitable circuitry and fed to an intelligent Pattern Recognition Engine for classification, analysis and measurement.
The most complicated parts of electronic olfaction process are odour capture and associated sensor technology. Any sensor that responds reversibly to chemicals in gas or vapour phase, has the potential to participate as a component of an array of sensor in an electronic nose. For black manufactured tea, an array of Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MoS) sensors has been used for measurement of volatiles.

"Electronic Vision:
Electronic Vision system is a non destructive, non-invasive, fast, quantifiable (objective) quality monitoring instrument of food and agro produces based on the appearance features of the product. It takes colour images of the sample in a constant illumination and uses digital image processing cum analysis techniques to find out different features of the object and finally determine the quality of the target object based on previously stored data which was taken during training of the system or by statistical algorithms. A number of software applications have been developed for different type of applications.
It uses a low cost digital camera which has Universal Serial Bus Interface with computer, white colored light emitting diode (LED) based illumination system which consume low power, rail mounted movable tray based easy to use sample holding arrangement with numerous attachment for different type of sample (liquid sample like tea liquor, solid sample like finished tea etc) holding attachments. To avoid the external interference of the light the whole system was designed as a enclosed cabinet, inside which the camera, illumination setup, sample holding tray have been placed. The digital camera takes the colour image, image processing algorithm process the image to highlight the specific features by enhancing the image contrast, removing the noise, segment the image from the background etc. Different types of image analysis algorithms (e.g. colour analysis, particle size analysis, shape detection, morphological features (area, perimeter, ratio of length and breadth, compact factor, shape factor, roundness etc) have been used to analysis the images based on the specific applications.

"Automatic Speaker Recognition using Voice Biometric
About Voice biometric and Speaker Recognition
Biometrics are some physiological or behavioral measurements of an individual. Such Biometrics can be either Physiological like Fingerprint, Face, Iris, Retina, Hand Geometry, DNA, Ear etc. or it can be Behavioral like Signature, Voice, Gait, Keystrokes etc. Use of Voice biometric is in high research now-a-days. Voice is the only biometric that allows users to authenticate remotely. Advantages related to voice biometric usage are like i) non intrusiveness, ii) wide availability and ease of transmission, iii) low cost, requiring small storage space and iv) ease of use, compact for small electronic devices with microphone etc. In contrary, there are also some disadvantages like i) low permanence, problems with aging, cough-cold, emotional changes, ii) problems with high background and network noise, iii) Sensitivity to room acoustics and device mismatch etc. Being a behavioral biometric, human Voice is not as unique as human DNA. But still, with precisely designed scope and applications, it can be attempted for specific authentication requirements in our regular everyday life. All these form the basis or motivation behind the challenging task of recognizing a person's identity using only voice biometric, which is known as Automatic Speaker Recognition. Depending upon the problem specification, the task can be either Automatic Speaker Identification (determining who is speaking) or Automatic Speaker Verification (validating whether the same person is speaking that has being claimed, or not)."

The subtitling system generates multilingual subtitle streams in DVB defined (ETSI EN 300 743) bitmap based subtitling format. Subtitles are generated as a graphical bitmap and then encoded and compressed into the DVB delivery format. The system generated subtitle stream is then multiplexed with the video, audio, data and then transmitted as part of the station's output transport stream to the Transmitter. The viewerâ€™s set-top-box / IDTV receives the subtitle data stream, decodes and re-constructs the subtitles in the decoder's memory and displays the subtitle on-screen at appropriate time. The viewer can also select whether to display subtitles or not and choose the language of his choice."

Product name: Industrial Coal Mill Soft Sensor (iCoMS)
Product description: As coal mills are the heart of the pulverized coal preparation system in coal fired power stations, coal mill process is of great significance to safe and efficient operation. Mill control need to respond effectively to changes in plant load and coal quality. The objective of controlling a mill is to regulate the amount of coal being ground in such a way that the proper amount of pulverized fuel is fed to the burners to meet the load requirements, while maintaining optimum operation of the mill itself. On the other hand, implementation of efficient master pressure control system for the boiler needs the measurement of pulverized coal flow which is the actual fuel input for the combustion. This pulverized coal is not at all measured in many of the thermal power plants and consequently the master pressure control system for the boiler exhibits very poor efficiency. CoMS is an innovative R&D effort in this direction where a pulverized coal flow soft sensor is developed for real time implementation in the SCADA System developed by C-DAC Thiruvananthapuram using a coal mill model and Evolutionary Computational Technique.

When such a crime occurs, immediately the front line officers will come and start the investigation. The truth is that, even if most officials are using various gadgets, they are not comfortable in doing even initial steps in investigation. This is mainly because of the high sensitivity of digital data, that once permanently lost could not be recovered. This lack in confidence among officials other than cybercrime experts shall be empowered with a forensic tool, which guides the investigator to all stages of initial triage according to a predefined work flow based on the suspect devices. Digital Forensic Kiosk (DFK) is a self-service platform which can be used as a first responder device for cybercrime investigation.

"The digital forensic kiosk will guide the user to start the investigation right on the spot to acquire data from devices involved in an incident. DFK fasten up the initial triage of evidence found and also helps the inquiry stage to progress early and the device with no valid data can be avoided from further investigation. If the lines of enquiry could be completed at scene of crime itself, over dumping of cases in cyber labs can be avoided and they can be freed to handle cases that needs good technical expertise. Devices that are identified with relevant data related to the crime can be acquired and handed over to cyber labs for further investigation. The need of digital evidence gathering exists at all levels of policing today.

Product name: TEXT INDEPENDENT AUTOMATIC SPEAKER RECOGNITION USING VOICE BIOMETRIC
Product description: The system consists of three main modules; Signal processing, Training and Testing. Firstly, for both training and testing purpose, the digitized speech is sent for Acoustic Feature Extraction and Voicing Detection. The feature vectors are composed of 12 lowest Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). Then a pitch extraction procedure is used to extract MFCC features frames only for the detected voiced regions, which are then used for speaker data training and testing purposes. In between, a pitch data frequency distribution is also prepared for each speaker, within normal human voicing range (generally 80 to 420 Hz). Later, in testing, this distribution is used for Pitch Based Dynamic Pruning (PBDP) of unlikely speakers before Matching.

During training process, individual speaker models or Codebooks are created by clustering the training feature vectors into few numbers of related clusters known as Code-vectors using the well known unsupervised Vector Quantization based clustering algorithm. Then weights are assigned to all the code-vectors by using a Speaker Discriminative Weighting scheme, such that code-vectors having higher discriminating power are assigned with the larger weights and vice-versa. In testing module, firstly a list of Most Likely speakers is created by PBDP. Then final matching scores are calculated between those speakersâ€™ weighted codebooks and the voiced MFCC frames of the test speech signal. The codebook that maximizes the similarity measure (with highest matching score) is the best matching codebook and hence is the identified Speaker.

Product name: RESHAM DARSHAN
Product description: The colour of Tasar yarns is determined by a number of production factors, any slight variation in any one of these factors lead to variation in colour of the yarn produced. At the present production technology, it is difficult to produce yarns of uniform colour at the producersâ€™ level, but once produced, those yarns can be sorted based on its colour to pack yarns of uniform colour in a pack. The other important characteristic of tasar silk yarn is its lustrous nature, it reflects light, thus difficult to ascertain the exact colour manually. Slight variation in colour is difficult to detect manually but the market demands lots with perfectly uniformly coloured yarns within the lot though inter-lot variation in colour is encouraged. Currently this sorting procedure is done manually by human experts only in daylight. As human intervention is required, the process is subjective, error-prone, labour-intensive and time consuming.
"
"Resham darshan system consists of a Lighting Arrangement, Camera Arrangement and Weight Measurement Arrangement. Along with these three modules the system has a sample-loading tray within it to put the sample for testing. Lighting arrangement has been designed for this system in such a manner that the illumination in all portion of the sample tray is almost uniform. This type of uniform illumination arrangement is necessary in silk color analysis because actual color of silk yarn samples varies with different intensities of light. A low cost webcam with 2 megapixel of still image sensor resolution has been used in camera arrangement. Camera arrangement has been fitted to the center of the light arrangement. The camera has been connected with the attached computer via USB 2.0 to feed the captured images to the Color Analysis Software. One weight measurement arrangement has been fitted under the sample-loading tray to measure the weight of testing sample. This module has been integrated for the ease of field level users."

Product name: Industrial Steam Temperature Control (iSTeC)

Product description: In a Coal fired thermal power plant, the highest work efficiency can be achieved by maintaining the highest possible steam temperature as limited by plant metallurgy. If these temperatures can be controlled with extreme precision, they can be pushed closer to the set point value of 541oC which leads to higher enthalpy of steam and maximum power generation. In the conventional control methods, due to the boiler and superheater dynamics and associated large process lag (8-10 minutes), it takes a long time to estimate whether the amount of spray/fuel provided is proper or not. As a result, correction is delayed and a temperature deviation of minimum +-10oC occurs during load change. iSTeC offers a comprehensive integrated mathematical model for the boiler and a Kalman filter based steam temperature prediction control system to reduce the steam temperature deviation to as low as +- 3oC

Use Cases

Product description: Multilingual and Heritage computing is one of the major thematic area of C-DAC. GIST has been a pioneer in Indian language computing, especially in areas of the script and natural language processing. GIST products / tools / technologies have been the backbone of several mission critical applications for bridging the digital divide. â€œNurturing the Living languagesâ€ is the moto of GIST Team

On the occasion of 29th Foundation day, C-DAC announces the release of first of its kind tools for the historically important Modi-Script

Modi-Script : History and Importance

Modi was invented as a cursive â€œshorthandâ€ or speed writing to note down the royal edicts. Over the centuries, Modi-script has undergone changes and can be classified as: Bahamani (16th century), Shivkalin (17th century), Peshwekalin (18th century) and Anglakalin (19th -20th century).   "
"Product name: Modi-Script Tools, developed by CDAC.
Traditional Devanagari was found to be excessively time-consuming since each character required as many as 3 to 5 strokes and the lifting of the hand, each time the stroke was completed. Modi got round this obstacle by â€œbendingâ€ the letters thereby doing away with the need of lifting the hand. This invention thus allowed for a continuous writing which could be used by court scribes to note the edicts. All official documents across the Maratha empire spread across India are archived in Modi-script. Learning Modi-Script is useful to Academician, Historian, Researcher and Legal experts and also for knowing more about cultural, heritage preservation

We aim to create awareness, increase proliferation, help in preservation of Modi-Script and generate interest in new generation of users

"Post Quantum Cryptography
Post Quantum Cryptography involves the development of classical cryptographic algorithms that are assumed to be safe against a quantum computer. These can be Lattice-based, Multivariate-based, or Hash-based cryptographic algorithms, etc. which can withstand certain attacks even from a quantum computer.

Although Post Quantum Cryptography for now spares us some time to be quantum-ready by being robust against certain quantum attacks, it doesn't provide us information-theoretic security and might become unsafe once the quantum algorithms are developed to be able to break them."

"Quantum Cryptography
The effectiveness of any cryptographic system relies on the privacy and strength of its secret keys. Considering the fact that modern-day cryptographic primitives are based on the complexity of one-way mathematical problems on classical computers, the advent of a universal quantum computer threatens its existence.

Quantum Key Distribution, as a measure against those risks, is the most mature branch of quantum communications. This technology generates encryption keys under the nose of an eavesdropper between two remote parties with information-theoretic security guaranteed by quantum principles like No cloning theorem, Heisenberg uncertainty principles, etc.

Utilization of Quantum Random Number Generators in cryptographic systems for obtaining secret keys gives us a higher degree of entropy and thus a higher level of security. As they are based on the inherent randomness of nature, they can provide us with private and uniformly distributed random numbers at high speed."

Product description: The Wireless Innovation Forum defines Software Defined Radio as a collection of hardware and software technologies where some or all of the radioâ€™s operating functions are implemented through modifiable software or firmware operating on programmable processing platforms. The part of software that defines the set of transformations applied to information to be transmitted and the corresponding set of transformations to convert received signals back to their information content is called a â€œwaveformâ€. The SDR â€œplatformâ€ acquires different radio personalities based on different waveforms.
A Cognitive Radio (CR) is a radio that is aware of its operational electromagnetic environment and is capable of dynamically adjusting its radio operating parameters to meet its communication objective. An SDR platform augmented   with a Sensing receiver forms a CR platform. A CR waveform typically possesses cognitive features like spectrum sensing, spectrum mobility and link adaptation over and above those of other SDR waveforms.

Product name: Ultrasonic Diameter Measuring System
Product description: Ultrasonic High Precision Diameter Measurement System (PreSys),developed for Babha Atomic Research Center (BARC), is used to measure the diameter of pipe structures with high precision better than 10 micro meter (in water). The system finds application in measuring precisely the diameter of heat-resistant composite alloy pipes employed in nuclear power plants. Due to the non-availability of high precision measurement system for measuring the wall thickness / internal diameter of the pipe, the pipe needs to be replaced very early than its actual period for replacement. The high precision measurement of internal pipe diameter helps to prolong the periodic replacement of pipes thereby reducing the overall cost for maintaining the nuclear power plant. The PreSys is capable of measuring diameter with a precision better than 10 micro meter in water/heavy water. The precise diameter measurement is achieved using innovative digital signal processing techniques and real time calibration algorithm to compensate for errors due to change in environmental parameters. The technology used in the system can be reused for a wide variety of high precision distance measurement applications.

Product name: Industrial Steam Temperature Control (iSTeC)
Product description: In a Coal fired thermal power plant, the highest work efficiency can be achieved by maintaining the highest possible steam temperature as limited by plant metallurgy. If these temperatures can be controlled with extreme precision, they can be pushed closer to the set point value of 541oC which leads to higher enthalpy of steam and maximum power generation. In the conventional control methods, due to the boiler and superheater dynamics and associated large process lag (8-10 minutes), it takes a long time to estimate whether the amount of spray/fuel provided is proper or not. As a result, correction is delayed and a temperature deviation of minimum +-10oC occurs during load change. iSTeC offers a comprehensive integrated mathematical model for the boiler and a Kalman filter based steam temperature prediction control system to reduce the steam temperature deviation to as low as +- 3oC
Use Cases
Process Industries, Power Plant etc.

Product name: Break-Out Prediction Software for Continuous Caster (BOPS)
Product description: Continuous casting is a part of steel manufacturing process, where the molten steel is solidified in a casting mould through heat extraction. Breakout is one of the catastrophic problems that happens in continuous casting process. Breakout occurs when solidifying strand steel shell ruptures or tears beneath the mould. There are several reasons due to which the solid shell of the strand breaks and allows the still liquid steel contained within it to spill out and damage the equipment of casters.
The Break-out Prediction Software (BOPS) is a secondary level SCADA application, which predicts the break-out in continuous casting process caused by sticker formation within the mould. BOPS software consists of a SCADA communication layer for real-time data acquisition from SCADA or its RTU. The break-out Prediction is carried out using the temperature signals available from instrumented mould. The software system provides a facility to fine-tune the performance of break-out prediction. It also supports producing 3 grades of steel with variable sizes. On identifying sticker, the software produces alarms and also generates caster speed control setpoints for breakout prevention. Field validation of the BOPS software had been successfully conducted at Caster#1 of Rourkela Steel Plant."

PARAMNet offers superior performance over commodity LANs using the following approach:

Offload the transport layer functionality in hardware, by developing specialized ""Communication Co-Processor"" hardware (CCP). Such a processor effectively decouples communication tasks from host processor, providing much better performance and freeing the host processor for running user application. A packet processor based solution also allows for near wire speed useable bandwidth and low latency path for fast communications.
Provide an extremely low latency, high throughput network cloud by developing specialized packet routing switches.
Provide a standard set of application level interfaces so that the user applications can be made to run on the specialized hardware with minimal changes.
Provide legacy support for TCP/IP based applications.
PARAMNet products are deployed by CDAC in its PARAM systems, as well as supplied commercially through its marketing division. PARAMNet has been deployed at various national and international sites.

RECONFIGURABLE COMPUTING (RC) CARD

Introduction

Reconfigurable ComputingReconfigurable Computing (RC) is an interesting paradigm to accelerate applications by targeting algorithms into programmable hardware.

One of the enabling technologies useful in RC is the field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Putting FPGAs on add-on cards or motherboards allow FPGAs to serve as compute-intensive co-processors. FPGAs can be re-configured over and over again, to perform multitude of operations. This enables application-specific, dynamically ""programmable"" hardware accelerators.

A number of Scientific & Engineering applications find RC technology useful. To name a few: satellite networks with adaptive communication algorithms, scalable computing systems, Encryption/Decryption engines and Pattern recognition.

C-DAC has pioneered the RC technology for HPC in India through its state-of-the-art design of hardware, system software and hardware libraries ('Avatars'). Avatars are dynamically changeable circuits, corresponding to the compute intensive routines of the application code. C-DAC with its expertise in RC is capable of providing accelerated solutions for a wide spectrum of scientific and engineering areas."

Applications

Scientific and engineering applications in the areas of fracture mechanics, radio astronomy and bioinformatics are ported on RC, providing up to 240X speedup compared to purely software based solutions. These speedups can further increase by manifolds based on the hardware configuration and nature of applications. In order to obtain same performance as RC hardware, one would require a huge cluster of computing nodes.

Reconfigurable Computing 2:
Bioinformatics sequence search solution using RC, gave 240 times faster results.
C-DAC's own fracture mechanics code, having double precision Cholesky factorization and forward-backward substitution steps ported on RC provided 16X speedup.
High speed data acquisition and signal processing solutions designed for Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) and power spectrum experimentation in radio astronomy, replaced sizable computing cluster.
Double precision matrix multiplication implemented on RC performed better than the Intel math kernel library.

RC Product Features:

Reconfigurable Computing 1:
Multi-million gate FPGAs for mapping compute intensive portions of application codes
Standard bus interface like PCI/PCI-X/PCI Express
System software Interface for all standard Linux distributions
Low power consumption
FCC and CE compliant

National Supercomputing Facilities
How to Access : Facilities such as NPSF have to run with the highest uptime and adequate technical support to provide a quality service to their users. This requires appropriate power back-up with UPS and DG sets and spares for technical resources all the time. Also, system administration and technical consultancy support are an integral part of running such a facility. Keeping in view the practice followed worldwide, a scheme, called the Technical Affiliation Scheme, is introduced with an express objective of encouraging the potential users of high-performance computing resources in a cost-effective way and providing a state-of-the-art technically congenial environment to the researchers in the NPSF.

This scheme is introduced to provide supercomputing facility to various industries as well as academic and R&D Institutions to process their diverse applications, which require supercomputing power. For a long time, it has not been economically viable for the industry and academic/R&D institutions to use High Performance Supercomputers.

This scheme is a step in the direction to address this problem by providing state-of-the-art ""PARAM"" systems to the users. For this, any interested user has to get enrolled as a Technical Affiliate of NPSF in order to use the computing resources of this facility. They can then use NPSF resources after agreeing to the terms and conditions for using the AIRAWAT-PSAI system at NPSF.

Interested user should visit the URL: https://npsf.cdac.in/tas/ for requesting the system access. OR they can send e-mail to npsf-outreach[at]cdac[dot]in."

Charging Policy : Usage Charges
Only registered users can use the NPSF resources. A registered user is referred to as an Affiliate. For this, the prospective user/affiliate has to fill up the account request form. The form is to be filled out for every single project that the prospective affiliate wants to register for using NPSF resources. The charges for the usage of different resources are given below.

Registration Fees
To use the HPC resources at NPSF, every project needs to get registered for a minimum period of one quarter (3 months). The registration charges cover an account for the CI and up to 5 user accounts including that of the Chief Investigator (CI) of the project. Also, the charges are applicable for the period of maximum of 1 year. That is, even if a user wishes to use the system for a few days, he/she will have to register for at least a quarter and pay the 1-year registration charges. Renewal of project after expiry, or after completion of a year, will be charged as stated above."
"HPC, Grid and Cloud Computing
National Supercomputing Facilities
Charging Policy : Compute Usage charges
The utilization for CPU Core is measured and charged on minute basis. The GPUs / Other Accelerator consumed will be charged in accelerator hours, i.e., number of hours of accelerator being used.

Storage Usage Charges
All HPC systems at NPSF are provisioned with high-bandwidth shared storage for use by users to keep their programs and data. There is a default quota allocated to each project that can be consumed. An additional requirement of storage will be charged extra on monthly basis and in the storage, units prescribed for each system. It is to be noted that as opposed to compute resources, charges for storage are calculated on allocation (quota) and not on consumption measured. There would be variations in charges for multiple different types of storage depending upon their performance parameters."
"HPC, Grid and Cloud Computing

Charging Policy : Priority Allocation and Usage
Users requiring the compute nodes in dedicated mode will be given priority over others, to allow jobs to go for execution as soon as the required resources are available. However, such priority allocations and usage will attract additional charges over and above that of non-priority (regular) usage. It is to be noted that priority allocation does not guarantee job execution immediately after submission and is limited to advancing the job's priority to order it at the beginning of the queue.

Consultation Charges
Consultation of C-DAC members towards usage of NPSF and on the specific user problem will be available at no cost to the user up to the initial one working day or equivalent. If an Affiliate requires consultancy of C-DAC members beyond this, separate charges will be applicable and these will be charged per support call on case-to-case basis."

To be able to generate knowledge from the oceans of genomic data, enabling technologies like High Performance Computing (HPC) and Grid Computing are the latest weapons in the hands of the modern biologist.

High Performance Computing (HPC) is one of the technology enablers which can accelerate the process of analyzing/data mining and simulation of the biological data. The computation is divided into sub-tasks and tens of thousands of processors are used to speed up tahe analysis/simulations. Most of the problems in the bioinformatics domain require computational infrastructure beyond the teraflop scale. The Bioinformatics team at C-DAC addresses these HPC requirements by porting an entire spectrum of Bioinformatics tools, databases and their allied resources onto large supercomputing clusters, and develops software like GIPSY which hides the complexity of a parallel machine from the biologist. The BioChrome and PARAM Yuva II are the main resources in this endeavor. PARAM Yuva II, is an indigenously built supercomputing machine with the peak computing power of 524TF, deployed by C-DAC at the National PARAM Supercomputing Facility (NPSF), Pune."

"About  MULTILINGUAL COMPUTING .
CDAC has been working in MULTILINGUAL COMPUTING since decades.
India is a unique country in the world having 22 scheduled languages besides heritage languages and over one hundred widely used languages with different scripts. Despite a very impressive growth of computers and the Internet over the past few decades, most of the content on the Internet and most of the ICT based solutions in India are still available only in English. This is in stark contrast to the ground reality as hardly 10% of Indians use English as a language for communication. C-DAC realized long ago that penetration of IT to masses is possible in India only if we develop tools and technologies to overcome this language barrier. Hence, for over the last 25 years, C-DAC has been pursuing pioneering research in Language Technology and Heritage Computing."

Cross Lingual Information Extraction & Retrieval
Natural Language Processing based Information Extraction & Retrieval
Introduction
Present age is called the ""Information Age"" and the story of human development hovers around information gathering, store information in forms of books or other formats and use them in later time that has helped human race to build on past experience. The content on Web in different languages is growing fast. Tremendous increase of online information repositories has created need for the retrieval of information across different languages.

This is where Information Extraction & Retrieval plays a pivotal role by making relevant information easily available to the end users of our system who can range from anyone having formal computer background or a layman in this field.

"CDAC has been working in MULTILINGUAL COMPUTING.
Cross Lingual Information Extraction & Retrieval.      
Applied Artificial Intelligence (AAI) Group focuses on solving research problems in the areas of Information (IE) & Retrieval (IR), using Natural Language Processing (NLP) based Semantic Search technique/algorithms for text mining applications to facilitate efficient and effective access of relevant information from the unstructured information sources. This information gets structured for the benefit of end users. Cross Lingual Information Retrieval is another milestone achieved by the group, which breaks language barrier and making information accessible to all users irrespective of language & region.

Semantic Search technique, which has been developed because of the limitations of Boolean keyword search technologies when dealing with large, unstructured digital collections of text. The technologies developed by the AAI Group seeks to devise formal ways to extract, distill, and standardize the embedded domain knowledge that has been instrumental in minimizing the overload of information & maximizing the scope of semantically relevant retrieval."
"MULTILINGUAL COMPUTING

Audio-Video Search : This system aims to focus on extraction & retrieval of information from audio and video sources, not just by their metadata, but by performing search on its content. Like textual information, audio & video files also contain multiple types of audio and visual information which are difficult to extract. For extracting information from such sources, automatically recognized Speech Transcripts, image similarity matching, are some of the major processes to be performed to make the information searchable. This application works on the transcribed text of the audio/video files. Transcription can also be achieved using Automatic Speech Recognition Technique developed.

"About  MULTILINGUAL COMPUTING .
CDAC has been working in MULTILINGUAL COMPUTING since decades.
India is a unique country in the world having 22 scheduled languages besides heritage languages and over one hundred widely used languages with different scripts. Despite a very impressive growth of computers and the Internet over the past few decades, most of the content on the Internet and most of the ICT based solutions in India are still available only in English. This is in stark contrast to the ground reality as hardly 10% of Indians use English as a language for communication. C-DAC realized long ago that penetration of IT to masses is possible in India only if we develop tools and technologies to overcome this language barrier. Hence, for over the last 25 years, C-DAC has been pursuing pioneering research in Language Technology and Heritage Computing."

Cross Lingual Information Extraction & Retrieval
Natural Language Processing based Information Extraction & Retrieval
Introduction
Present age is called the ""Information Age"" and the story of human development hovers around information gathering, store information in forms of books or other formats and use them in later time that has helped human race to build on past experience. The content on Web in different languages is growing fast. Tremendous increase of online information repositories has created need for the retrieval of information across different languages.

This is where Information Extraction & Retrieval plays a pivotal role by making relevant information easily available to the end users of our system who can range from anyone having formal computer background or a layman in this field.

"CDAC has been working in MULTILINGUAL COMPUTING.
Cross Lingual Information Extraction & Retrieval.      
Applied Artificial Intelligence (AAI) Group focuses on solving research problems in the areas of Information (IE) & Retrieval (IR), using Natural Language Processing (NLP) based Semantic Search technique/algorithms for text mining applications to facilitate efficient and effective access of relevant information from the unstructured information sources. This information gets structured for the benefit of end users. Cross Lingual Information Retrieval is another milestone achieved by the group, which breaks language barrier and making information accessible to all users irrespective of language & region.

Semantic Search technique, which has been developed because of the limitations of Boolean keyword search technologies when dealing with large, unstructured digital collections of text. The technologies developed by the AAI Group seeks to devise formal ways to extract, distill, and standardize the embedded domain knowledge that has been instrumental in minimizing the overload of information & maximizing the scope of semantically relevant retrieval."
"MULTILINGUAL COMPUTING

Audio-Video Search : This system aims to focus on extraction & retrieval of information from audio and video sources, not just by their metadata, but by performing search on its content. Like textual information, audio & video files also contain multiple types of audio and visual information which are difficult to extract. For extracting information from such sources, automatically recognized Speech Transcripts, image similarity matching, are some of the major processes to be performed to make the information searchable. This application works on the transcribed text of the audio/video files. Transcription can also be achieved using Automatic Speech Recognition Technique developed. 

Its principle features are:

1. Storage of Audio & Video data.
2. IProcessing of Audio & Video Data.
3. Audio/ Video Search through NLP based Retrieval Engine.
